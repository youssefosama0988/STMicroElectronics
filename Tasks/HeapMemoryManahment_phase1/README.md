# *Heap Memory Management*
### Overview
This project includes implementations of the **malloc** and **free** functions to manage dynamic memory allocation on the heap. The goal is to provide insight into how memory allocation works under the hood.

### Features
- **Custom malloc** Implementation: Allocates a block of memory of a specified size.
- **Custom free** Implementation: Deallocates previously allocated memory.
- **Educational**: Designed to help understand memory management concepts



### Building commands 
```

  git clone repoURL
  gcc main.c HMM.c LinkedList.c -o hmm
  ./hmm                                 // to run the program (main.c include the test).

```
