# *Heap Memory Management*
 contains a custom implementation of heap memory management functions, including **malloc** and **free**. The purpose of this implementation is to demonstrate and explore how dynamic memory allocation can be managed at a low level.
 
## Overview
This project includes implementations of the **malloc** and **free** functions to manage dynamic memory allocation on the heap. The goal is to provide insight into how memory allocation works under the hood.

## Features
- **Custom malloc** Implementation: Allocates a block of memory of a specified size.
- **Custom free** Implementation: Deallocates previously allocated memory.
- **Educational**: Designed to help understand memory management concepts



## Building commands 
```

  git clone repoURL
  gcc main.c HMM.c LinkedList.c -o hmm
  ./hmm                                 // to run the program (main.c include the test).

```
